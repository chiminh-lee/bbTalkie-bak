## A Mini Walkie-Talkie That’s a Bit Different

Traditional walkie-talkies are usually bulky, clunky, and require you to press a button to talk. One day while cycling, I wondered—could I make a portable, hands-free walkie-talkie instead?

So I DIYed a **not-so-ordinary walkie-talkie**. It uses an **embedded neural network 🧠** to automatically detect human voice 🗣️, recognize keywords to trigger animations, and even convert other conversations into text bubbles on the screen. It’s surprisingly fun to use!

## How to Use & FAQ

* You need an **ESP32-S3 with 16MB Flash and 8MB PSRAM**.
  Only this configuration supports **Octal PSRAM**—otherwise, PSRAM speed is insufficient and may cause the ESP-SR audio framework to freeze.

* The **external antenna version is recommended**:
  **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U-N16R8**

* Compile and flash the firmware using the **ESP-IDF development environment**.

* Bluetooth camera control is implemented in a very basic form and currently supports **SONY cameras**.
  Since Bluetooth consumes a large amount of memory and is not commonly used, it is maintained in a separate branch named **`ble-camera`**.

* More content and updates may be added in the future as needed.
